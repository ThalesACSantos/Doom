class PathFinding:
    """
    Provides pathfinding capabilities for navigating the game map. 
    This class uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two points on the map.

    The class initializes with a reference to the game and constructs a graph representation of the navigable areas. 
    It includes methods to retrieve paths, perform BFS, and generate possible next nodes based on the current position.

    Args:
        game: The game instance that contains the map and other game elements.

    Attributes:
        map: The mini-map representation of the game world.
        ways: Possible movement directions for pathfinding.
        graph: A dictionary representing the graph of navigable nodes.
